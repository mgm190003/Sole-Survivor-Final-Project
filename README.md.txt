My project is a small game where you play as a white square being attacked by red squares. 
You need to point your mouse cursor towards the red squares to shoot green squares at them and destroy them
use WASD to move and point your mouse towards an enemy to automatically shoot
The closer your mouse is to the player the slower the projectile moves so you can use that to your advantage to predict where enemies will be
I spent a lot of time working on this project and am really proud of what I have made so far, even if it is very simple
